# Testing Guide

This directory contains the test suite for the Polis server. The tests are organized by type (unit, integration, e2e) and use Jest as the test runner.

## Getting Started

To run the tests, you'll need:

- A local PostgreSQL database for testing
- Node.js and npm installed

## Running Tests

### All Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Unit Tests Only

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### Integration Tests Only

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### Feature Tests Only

```bash
npm run test:feature
```

### Run Specific Tests

```bash
# Run tests in a specific file
npm test -- __tests__/integration/participation.test.js

# Run tests that match a specific name
npm test -- -t "should do something specific"
```

## Database Setup for Tests

The tests require a clean database state to run successfully. There are several ways to manage this:

### Option 1: Reset Database Before Running Tests

This will completely reset your database, dropping and recreating it with a fresh schema:

```bash
# Reset the database immediately
npm run db:reset

# Run tests with a database reset first
RESET_DB_BEFORE_TESTS=true npm test
```

⚠️ **WARNING**: The `db:reset` script will delete ALL data in the database specified by `DATABASE_URL`.

## Mailer Testing

An ses-local container is typically running (see `docker-compose.dev.yml`) and will capture emails sent during testing.

## Response Format Handling

The test suite includes robust handling for the various response formats from the API:

- **JSON Responses**: Automatically parsed into JavaScript objects
- **Text Responses**: Preserved as strings
- **Gzipped Content**: Automatically detected and decompressed, even when incorrectly marked
- **Mixed Content-Types**: Handles cases where JSON content is served with non-JSON content types

## Test Safety Features

The test environment includes this safety feature:

- **Production Database Prevention**: Tests will not run against production databases (URLs containing 'amazonaws', 'prod', etc.)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Participant Creation Issues

If tests fail with duplicate participant errors, try:

```bash
npm run db:reset
```

### Database Connection Errors

Check that:

1. Your PostgreSQL server is running
2. Your DATABASE_URL environment variable is correct
3. Database and schema exist (you can use `npm run db:reset` to create them)

### Test Timeouts

If tests timeout, try:

1. Increase the timeout in individual tests:

   ```javascript
   jest.setTimeout(90000); // Set timeout to 90 seconds
   ```

2. Check for any blocking async operations that might not be resolving

## OIDC Simulator Setup (for JWT Tests)

Integration tests for JWT-based authentication use `@simulacrum/auth0-simulator`. This simulator runs an HTTPS server and requires locally trusted SSL certificates. We use `mkcert` to generate these certificates.

**One-time Setup:**

1. **Install `mkcert`**:
   Follow the installation instructions for your operating system on the [mkcert GitHub repository](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).
   For example, on macOS with Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install mkcert
   brew install nss # if you use Firefox
   ```

2. **Install a local Certificate Authority (CA)**:
   This command creates a local CA and installs it in your system's trust stores. You may be prompted for your password.

   ```bash
   mkcert -install
   ```

3. **Generate Certificates for the Simulator**:
   The OIDC simulator, by default, looks for certificates in `~/.simulacrum/certs/`. Create these certificates for `localhost` with custom file names:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.simulacrum/certs
   (cd ~/.simulacrum/certs && mkcert -cert-file localhost.pem -key-file localhost-key.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1)
   ```

   This will create `localhost.pem` (certificate) and `localhost-key.pem` (private key) in that directory, which are the specific file names expected by the OIDC simulator.

**How it Works with Tests:**

- The OIDC simulator, when started within the Jest tests (`__tests__/integration/auth-jwt.test.ts`), will automatically find and use these certificates.
- The application server (Node.js) needs to trust this local CA when fetching the JWKS URI from the simulator. The `npm test` script in `package.json` handles this by setting the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem jest",
    // ... other scripts
  }
  ```

  This command dynamically finds the path to your `mkcert` root CA certificate (`rootCA.pem`) and tells Node.js to trust it.

If you encounter SSL errors related to the OIDC simulator or JWKS fetching during tests, ensure you have completed these `mkcert` setup steps.
