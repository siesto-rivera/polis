    <criticalInstructions>
        <instruction>
            Generate a JSON response that conforms to the provided schema. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OTHER
            TEXT.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            DO NOT return ```json at the beginning of the response. This is not markdown. Do not end
            the response with ```, your response MUST begin with { and end with }
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            Analyze and include ALL comments that show consensus patterns — the data is already
            filtered for those with the requisite score threshold for group-aware consensus.
            The analysis should be exhaustive and comprehensive, potentially spanning many
            paragraphs.
            Each consensus pattern should be supported by multiple comment citations.
        </instruction>
        <instruction>
            Group related comments into coherent themes, but ensure every relevant comment is cited
            at least once.
            Aim for 100% coverage of consensus comments in the dataset.

                    detailed analysis of each theme. It requires citations for every clause.
