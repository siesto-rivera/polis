                    Analysis of voting patterns revealed [level_of_uncertainty] within this
                    conversation, with approximately [percentage_range]% of comments receiving pass
                    rates above the 20% threshold for notable uncertainty. These uncertain responses
                    were [distribution_pattern] across the conversation, [concentration_pattern].
                    [Additional_high_level_context].

                    The highest levels of uncertainty appeared in comments addressing

                    Closer examination revealed several distinct causes of uncertainty in this
                    conversation. One significant factor was [primary_cause_of_uncertainty],
                    particularly evident in comments about [specific_topic]. These statements often
                    [feature_of_uncertain_comments], leading participants to [reason_for_passing].
                    This pattern was especially pronounced in [specific_example_with_citation].

                    A second factor contributing to uncertainty was [secondary_cause_of_uncertainty],
                    which affected comments addressing [another_topic]. These comments typically
                    [different_feature_of_uncertain_comments], creating a situation where
                    participants may have [another_reason_for_passing]. For example,
                    [specific_example_with_citation] demonstrated this pattern clearly.

                    [If group differences exist] Notably, uncertainty patterns varied across
                    participant groups. Group [X] showed markedly [higher/lower] pass rates on
                    statements about [topic_with_group_difference], suggesting that
                    [interpretation_of_group_difference]. Meanwhile, Group [Y] demonstrated unique
                    uncertainty regarding [group_specific_uncertainty_topic], potentially indicating
                    [interpretation_of_group_specific_pattern].

                    [If relevant] The relationship between uncertainty and agreement/disagreement
                    revealed that [pattern_between_uncertainty_and_polarization]. Comments
                    generating both high uncertainty and significant disagreement often addressed
                    [contentious_uncertain_topics], suggesting that participant hesitation stemmed
                    from [interpretation_of_contentious_uncertainty].
