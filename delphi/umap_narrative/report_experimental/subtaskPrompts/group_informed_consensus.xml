                    Analysis of voting patterns revealed [level_of_consensus] across different
                    participant groups, with [number_of_comments] comments showing strong agreement
                    that transcended group divisions. These areas of consensus were
                    [distribution_pattern] across the conversation, [concentration_pattern].
                    [Additional_high_level_context].

                    The strongest areas of cross-group agreement centered on [primary_consensus_topic],
                    with several statements receiving consistently high agreement from all groups.
                    These comments shared common features, including [shared_feature_1] and

                    The consensus areas identified in this conversation reveal important shared
                    values across participant groups, despite their differences on other topics.
                    Most notably, the widespread agreement on [primary_consensus_topic] suggests
                    that [shared_value_interpretation], even among groups that disagree sharply
                    on [divisive_topic]. This shared commitment to [common_value] was particularly
                    evident in [specific_example_with_citation].

                    Another important area of common ground emerged around [secondary_consensus_topic],
                    where agreement across groups indicated shared [another_common_value]. Despite
                    differing approaches to [related_divisive_topic], participants from all groups
                    expressed support for [specific_position], as seen in [another_specific_example].
                    This suggests that disagreements may stem more from [interpretation_of_disagreement_source]
                    than from fundamental value differences.

                    These consensus areas potentially offer valuable starting points for bridge-building
                    between otherwise divided groups. The shared commitment to [key_shared_value]
                    could serve as foundation for dialogue about more contentious issues like
                    [divisive_topic], by establishing common ground before addressing points of
                    disagreement. Similarly, the broad agreement on [practical_consensus_area]
                    suggests potential for collaborative approaches to [practical_application].
